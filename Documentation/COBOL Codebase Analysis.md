# COBOL Codebase Analysis Using Python and Visitor Pattern
## Process Overview

### 1. Identify the Code Structure and Files

- Identify the **COBOL program structure**, including divisions (IDENTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENT, DATA, and PROCEDURE).
- Locate relevant **file types**:
    - `.cbl`, `.cob`: COBOL source files.
    - `.cpy`: Copybooks containing reusable data definitions.
    - Configuration files (`JCL`, `SQL scripts`, `INI` files) related to job execution and database access.
    - Log files containing execution traces and error reports.
- Understand how **log files** are structured and what runtime information they provide about batch jobs, transactions, and integrations.

### 2. Generate a Parser and Lexer

- Use **ANTLR4** to define a COBOL grammar or leverage existing ones (e.g., `cobol85.g4`).
- Generate a **Python-based parser** to construct a **parse tree** from COBOL source code.
- Ensure that the parser generates a **visitor class** to traverse the parse tree efficiently.

### 3. Extract Critical Information

- Implement visitor methods to retrieve **key COBOL constructs**, such as:
    - **Program entry points** (`PROGRAM-ID` section in the IDENTIFICATION DIVISION).
    - **Variable declarations** (`DATA DIVISION`, `WORKING-STORAGE`, `FILE SECTION`).
    - **File and database operations** (`OPEN`, `READ`, `WRITE`, `EXEC SQL` statements).
    - **External API calls** (`CALL` statements to external modules, middleware like TIBCO, or stored procedures).
    - **Conditional logic and branching** (`IF`, `EVALUATE`, `PERFORM` statements to understand flow control).
- If available, analyze **production logs** to:
    - Identify **active** and **potentially abandoned** features.
    - Detect performance bottlenecks and error-prone modules.

### 4. Visualize Code Usage Patterns

- Generate **heat maps** or **word clouds** to:
    - Highlight frequently used **procedures**, **variables**, and **service calls**.
    - Identify **dead code** or rarely used sections.
- Use **network graphs** to visualize module dependencies and integration points.

### 5. Identify Key Entry Points

- Scan the COBOL codebase to locate **program start points**, typically `PROGRAM-ID` in batch programs and `PROCEDURE DIVISION` entry points for online transactions.
- Identify **dependency chains**:
    - Which modules call each other?
    - What external systems interact with the COBOL programs?
    - How data flows between different components?

### 6. Map the Application Flow

- Discover the **execution flow** starting from entry points:
    - Track method calls, **PERFORM** statements, and **CALL** operations.
    - Analyze interactions between **copybooks**, **data files**, and **databases**.
- Document the discovered **application flow** using **BPMN 2.0**:
    - Visualize service calls, decision paths, and module interactions.
    - Generate diagrams to illustrate system-wide integration.

## Conclusion

By following this structured approach using Python, ANTLR, and the Visitor Pattern, you can gain **deep insights** into a COBOL legacy codebase, identify **areas for optimization**, and facilitate **modernization efforts** such as migration to microservices or cloud architectures.
